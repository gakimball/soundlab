# SoundLab Beaker (working title)

A Web Audio API wrapper and sound library manager.

## Usage

This is the start of a backend wrapper for the SoundLab framework that will eventually act as a blueprint for uploading, playing and manipulating sounds.

It's built on Python's Flask microframework. To start just:

	python run.py

And head to `localhost:5000`

To play with the JavaScript, go to the `main/public/js` directory and check out the source.

Head to the [master branch](http://github.com/gakimball/soundlab) for information about the audio library.

## Browser Compatability

Only tested in Chrome 28. Support for the Web Audio API is very limited right now.
